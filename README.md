# Cyberpunk City Text-to-Image Generation using Pretrained Stable Diffusion

A final-year university deep learning project that builds a complete text-to-image system for **cyberpunk city scene generation** using pretrained Stable Diffusion.

This repository includes:
- a **Jupyter notebook prototype** for experimentation,
- a **Flask web app** for interactive demo,
- organized project assets for a 5–6 member team.

---

## 1) Project Description

### Problem Statement
Generating visually coherent cyberpunk city scenes from natural language prompts is a practical use case for modern diffusion models. This project explores prompt-controlled generation, reproducibility (seed control), and quality tuning (guidance scale and inference steps).

### Objectives
- Build an end-to-end text-to-image pipeline with pretrained Stable Diffusion.
- Compare prompt engineering strategies for better visual quality.
- Deliver both a research notebook workflow and a web-based demo.
- Prepare a reproducible, team-friendly repository for a university final project.

### Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch + Diffusers
- Flask
- Jupyter Notebook

## 4) Suggested Experiments

Use this section as your final project experiment checklist:

1. **Prompt Detail Ablation**
   - Compare short prompts vs detailed prompts.
   - Evaluate scene complexity, lighting, and realism.

2. **Guidance Scale Sweep**
   - Try values: 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5.
   - Observe prompt adherence vs artifact risk.

3. **Inference Steps Sweep**
   - Try values: 20, 30, 40, 50.
   - Measure visual quality vs generation time.

4. **Seed Reproducibility Test**
   - Fix prompt/settings and vary seeds.
   - Analyze diversity and consistency.

5. **Negative Prompt Study**
   - Compare outputs with and without negative prompts.
   - Track common artifact reduction.

## 6) Course Deliverables Mapping

- **Literature Review**: diffusion models + text-to-image landscape.
- **Implementation**: notebook + Flask app.
- **Experiments**: prompt engineering and hyperparameter sweeps.
- **Evaluation**: qualitative grid and artifact analysis.
- **Final Demo**: live web generation with curated prompts.

---

## 7) Notes

- First generation can be slow due to model download/caching.
- CPU inference works but may be significantly slower.
- For deterministic results, keep all settings + seed fixed.
